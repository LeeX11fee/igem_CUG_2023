            <p>Human productive activities and normal life are closely related to microbes, and biofilm presents the prevalent mode of microbial growth in natural, engineered and medical settings. The existence of biofilm has both advantages and disadvantages for human beings. If the formation and degradation of biofilm can be controlled artificially, it will bring great benefits to human production and life. Numerous studies have shown that the formation and degradation of biofilms are controlled by cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) in a wide range of bacteria.  By talking with Prof. Zeng from the Institute of Hydrobiology, we knew that they urgently need an effective c-di-GMP measurement tool for their research at present. Through the interviews with experts from Biopharmaceutical Enterprises, we knew that there is still a lack of a high-throughput screening tool for c-di-GMP targeted drugs. These all spirited us build a biosensor which can monitor the intracellular c-di-GMP concentration in a certain cell in real time using synthetic biology approaches, which could provide a powerful method for biofilm research. While we conduct a series of work, we also keep in touch with experts and constitutively improve our constructions to adapt to actual production and research. As iGEMers, we are happy to share, communicate and collaborate with researchers, and are committed to introducing  synthetic biology to the public.</p>

            <p>Prof. Xiaoli Zeng's team, from Institute of Hydrobiology Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, has been doing the research about the function of c-di-GMP in Cyanobacteria for many years. In order to have a better understanding of the regulatory role c-di-GMP in microorganism, we visited Institute of Hydrobiology and had a wonderful talk with Prof. Zeng.</p>
            <p>Prof. Zeng told us that c-di-GMP plays a very important role in growth and survival of many bacteria. C-di-GMP has different functions in different strains of Cyanobacteria. During their study, it is crucial to monitor intracellular c-di-GMP concentration of Cyanobacteria in real-time. Currently, they detect intracellular c-di-GMP concentration by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The sample preparation includes cell lysis, c-di-GMP extraction and sample concentration, which is time-cost; and it was found that c-di-GMP could dynamically change during the sample preparation due to the activities of its synthases and hydrolases. Moreover, such method cannot achieve real-time c-di-GMP monitoring. There is no an effective method for the real-time monitoring of  intracellular c-di-GMP concentration. The problems they are facing for c-di-GMP measurement inspired us to develop a new approach to easily detect the intracellular c-di-GMP level in real time.</p>
            <p>When we tested our biosensor, we found that the fluorescence was disproportionate to the concentration of c-di-GMP, and our biosensor showed a narrow dynamical range.  To overcome these limits, Prof. Zeng suggested to consider the avidity of transcription factor FleQ with c-di-GMP. If possible, it should be more desirable that creating FleQ mutants with different avidity of c-di-GMP could be selected for biosensor construction according to the native c-di-GMP concentration in a certain cell.</p>
